Add the constraint that the test taker must write code that handles cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across different programming languages.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nBoolean operators are logical operators used in programming to manipulate boolean values. They operate on one or more boolean operands and return a boolean result. The three main boolean operators are \"AND\" (&&), \"OR\" (||), and \"NOT\" (!).\\n\\nThe \"AND\" operator returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) and (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"OR\" operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) or (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"NOT\" operator negates the boolean value of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = not (x > 10)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nOperator precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. It ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly. In most programming languages, logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = True or False and False  # This expression is evaluated as (True or (False and False)), which is True\\n```\\n\\nShort-circuit evaluation is a behavior where the second operand of a logical operator is not evaluated if the result can be determined based on the value of the first operand. In short-circuit evaluation, if the first operand of an \"AND\" operator is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be false. Similarly, if the first operand of an \"OR\" operator is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be true.\\n\\nIn programming languages that support short-circuit evaluation natively, you can use it to improve performance or avoid errors. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nif x != 0 and (y / x) > 10:\\n    # Perform some operation\\n```\\n\\nIn languages without native short-circuit evaluation, you can implement your own logic to achieve the same behavior. Here\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\n\\n```\\nif x != 0 {\\n    if (y / x) > 10 {\\n        // Perform some operation\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTruthiness and falsiness refer to how non-boolean values are evaluated in boolean contexts. In many programming languages, non-zero numbers and non-empty strings are considered truthy, while zero, empty strings, and null/None values are considered falsy.\\n\\nWhen evaluating boolean expressions, truthiness and falsiness come into play. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = x  # The value of x is truthy, so result is also truthy\\n```\\n\\nTo handle cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across programming languages, you can explicitly check the desired condition. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = bool(x)  # Explicitly converting x to a boolean value\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that the result is always a boolean value, regardless of the language\\'s truthiness and falsiness rules.<|eot_id|>'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from trl import DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM\n","response_template = \"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"\n","instruction_template = \"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\"\n","collator = DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM(response_template, instruction_template, tokenizer=tokenizer)"],"metadata":{"id":"E8Ad96GKVr-s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744277151187,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":306,"user":{"displayName":"Kasidis Kanwatchara","userId":"16282887364982711910"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["batch = collator([tokenizer(example, padding=False) for example in dataset[\"text\"][:2]])"],"metadata":{"id":"Ip3urS5_toMZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744277151493,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"Kasidis Kanwatchara","userId":"16282887364982711910"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["batch"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UOYCoEPuuahG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744277151496,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Kasidis Kanwatchara","userId":"16282887364982711910"}},"outputId":"4a2fc6a5-b977-4afa-e2a2-bafa463ddd74"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'input_ids': tensor([[128000, 128000, 128006,  ...,   5718,     13, 128009],\n","        [128004, 128004, 128004,  ...,    220,     16, 128009]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1,  ..., 1, 1, 1],\n","        [0, 0, 0,  ..., 1, 1, 1]]), 'labels': tensor([[  -100,   -100,   -100,  ...,   5718,     13, 128009],\n","        [  -100,   -100,   -100,  ...,    220,     16, 128009]])}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"idAEIeSQ3xdS"},"source":["<a name=\"Train\"></a>\n","### Train the model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"95_Nn-89DhsL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744277158496,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":7001,"user":{"displayName":"Kasidis Kanwatchara","userId":"16282887364982711910"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig\n","\n","trainer = SFTTrainer(\n","    model = model,\n","    train_dataset = dataset,\n","    data_collator=collator,\n","    formatting_func=formatting_prompts_func,\n","    args = SFTConfig(\n","        max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n","        per_device_train_batch_size = 1,\n","        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,\n","        warmup_steps = 5,\n","        max_steps = 60,\n","        learning_rate = 2e-4,\n","        fp16 = True,\n","        logging_steps = 1,\n","        optim = \"adamw_8bit\",\n","        weight_decay = 0.01,\n","        lr_scheduler_type = \"linear\",\n","        # gradient_checkpointing=True,\n","        seed = 3407,\n","        output_dir = \"outputs\",\n","        label_names=[\"labels\"],\n","        report_to = \"none\", # Use this for WandB etc\n","    ),\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title Show current memory stats\n","gpu_stats = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0)\n","start_gpu_memory = round(torch.cuda.max_memory_reserved() / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 3)\n","max_memory = round(gpu_stats.total_memory / 1024 / 1024 / 1024, 3)\n","print(f\"GPU = {gpu_stats.name}.
